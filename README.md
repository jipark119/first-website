To celebrate Lunar New Year, I've decided to share my favorite New Year recipe Mandu!
If you’ve never heard of mandu, it’s a Korean-style dumpling that can be filled with a variety of toppings and boiled, steamed, or fried. This recipe uses a mixture of tofu, pork, beef, kimchi, scallions, and seasonings. The mandu are boiled until they’re tender, chewy, and bursting with flavor.
